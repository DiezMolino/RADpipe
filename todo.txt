1. Incorporate restriction site trimming subroutines into process_rawreads.py. Script contains comments at logical places for incorporation.
2. Need support for following restriction enzymes: sbfI, sau3AI, mspI/hpaII, pstI
3. Save output/logs properly (clone_filter, maybe others)
4. Merge all quality-trimmed reads into single file for use in generating pseudo-reference contigs
5. Incorporate adapter list/trimming into Trimmomatic and Stacks
